# Sprint-Analysis-using-openCV
 Developed a real-time performance analysis application for sprinters using the CNN Movenet lightning
 Model for precise pose estimation.
 ◦ Conducted training on a multivariate regression model using data from 30 Olympians (sprinters) to predict
 optimal values for critical parameters such as stride length, arm angle, hip-knee angle, etc.
 ◦ Implemented a comprehensive feedback system by comparing actual parameter values to predicted ones, offering
 valuable insights for performance improvement.
 ◦ Leveraged Streamlit to create an intuitive and interactive application, enhancing accessibility and usability for
 coaches and athletes
